Tea belongs to the family Camelliaceae and all the cultivated tea plants belong to two distinct species, viz., Camellia sinensis (L). O. Kuntze, the short leaved ‘China’ plants and Camellia assamica (Masters) Wight, the broad leaved ‘Assam’ plants. The ‘Cambod’ variety, a subspecies of the latter, is named C. Assamica lasiocalyx (Planchon exwatt) Wight. The ‘China’, ‘Assam’ and ‘Cambod’ and a large number of their hybrids are seen in many tea fields. It is believed that many wild species of teas have also contributed to the present-day hybrid population of cultivated tea plants.
The widespread occurrence of the leaf rust (Hemilia vastatrix Berk & Br.) Of coffee and the consequent decline of the coffee industry was a major factor responsible for the extensive planting of tea in south India. The tea growing tracks of south India, extending along the Western Ghats, vary in their elevation from 300 to 2,300 m above MSL and experience an annual rainfall ranging from 90-750 cm. These plantations, with their adjoining forest ecosystem contribute greatly to the maintenance of terrestrial ecology by providing extensive land cover and minimizing soil erosion.
In this paper, our motto is to obtain information on the present market of Tea in South India using Business Analytics and Market Segmentation techniques. A detailed analysis of the various aspects of South Indian tea and its customer base is carried out through machine learning techniques such as Clustering. The case study focuses on the clustering pipeline using limited amount of data obtained from several trusted platforms, including government open source.
